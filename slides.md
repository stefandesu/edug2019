## What is Cocoda?

Cocoda is a web-based tool for semi-automatic creation of mappings between different vocabularies.

---

## Background

- Developed by the GBV Head Office (VZG) in GÃ¶ttingen, Germany.
- Part of Project coli-conc: https://coli-conc.gbv.de
- The mapping tool and its background services are available as open source repositories on GitHub.
- The data is openly available through APIs.

---

## Data Sources

- Data sources use the JSKOS format (SKOS in JSON-LD, https://gbv.github.io/jskos/).
- In Cocoda, different sources are configurable for
  - vocabularies
  - concepts
  - existing mappings
  - mapping recommendations

## Multilanguage Support

- New languages can be added easily.
- Supports vocabulary data in multiple languages, e.g. Wikidata.
  - Currently, most of the available vocabularies in Cocoda are in German.

## Mappings

- Project coli-conc collected existing concordances with around 385,000 mappings.
- Additionally, mapping data from Wikidata is available (another ~? mappings).
